# EMA_Crossover
Overview
This repository provides a Python implementation of an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Crossover Strategy for trading. The strategy uses two EMAs with different periods to generate buy and sell signals based on the crossover points. When the short-term EMA crosses above the long-term EMA, it signals a potential buy, and when it crosses below, it signals a potential sell.

Features
Automatic Data Download: Uses the yfinance library to download historical stock data.
EMA Calculation: Computes both short-term and long-term EMAs using pandas for fast and efficient calculations.
Signal Generation: Generates buy and sell signals based on EMA crossovers.
Visualization: Plots stock prices, EMAs, and buy/sell signals for easy interpretation using matplotlib.
